# Mapping-the-RSSE-landscape-in-Africa

**TL;DR**: Mapping African research software groups and relevant communities of practice to grow the RSE movement in Africa.  

This project aims to identify African research groups that are heavily involved in in-house research software development and could potentially benefit from being part of RSSE-Africa and the larger global RSE movement. This may, for example, include data science research initiatives at universities, bioinformatics or astronomy groups, computational social sciences and digital humanities groups, and many more. Furthermore, the project will identify open communities of practice related to research software and systems engineering, such as RLadies, Python User Groups, and HPC User Groups that could potentially supplement the support RSSE-Africa is providing.

For communities of practice, we will:
* collect information on several attributes
  * their focus area
  * communication platforms
  * activities offered, and more. 

The project will build on work done by members of the RSSE-Africa community and the Research Software Alliance (ReSA).
